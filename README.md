# granite-completebench

This is a fairly simply benchmark suite for models with IDE-style
autocompletion. The target here is tests that we need for the
development of [Granite.Code](https://granitecode.ai). In particular,
we're interested in the combination of:

 * Prompts and postprocessing in the style of [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/).
 * The [IBM Granite Models](https://www.ibm.com/granite)
